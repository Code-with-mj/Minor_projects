            <small>Beautiful scenery</small>
            <p>
                The most beautiful creation of God that exists all around us is nature, which is seen as being essence
                of everything. Water, air, plants, and many other things have been given to us by nature so that we can
                survive on this earth. A person with a sense of beauty will never be able to overlook the splendour of
                the twinkling stars and the crimson light of the rising sun. The beauty of nature has inspired many
                artistic people to compose verses of praise, show their creative side with paints and brushes, write
                beautiful prose and capture the beauty of nature with a camera forever.

            <p>
                Mother Nature is responsible for our very existence as humans, but we don't seem to recognise this
                unique truth or show her any respect. Instead we are polluting and ruining our environment. Use of
                natural resources increases as the population grows. Coal and petroleum are in greater demand due to the
                growing manufacturing sector, however they pollute the air. The air we breathe has been tainted by smoke
                released from industries and automobiles. We must plant more trees if we want to lessen the impact of
                harmful air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc. Mother Nature is
                constantly being abused by mankind, who don't even consider the repercussions.
