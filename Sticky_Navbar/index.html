        <h2>Bugatti chiron</h2>
        <p>
            The Bugatti Chiron is a mid engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in germany and manufactured
            in Molsheim,France,by Franch automobile manufactures Bugatti Automobiles SAS.
            All Chiron models are motivated by an 8.0-liter 16-cylinder powerplant. This beast of an engine employs four
            turbochargers to generate a mighty 1500 horsepower and 1180 pound-feet of torque. Bugatti claims that the
            Chiron makes the dash from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.3 seconds, and it has a top speed of 261 mph. If the
            Chiron's standard engine doesn't quench your thirst for speed, step up to the Chiron Super Sport. This model
            is equipped with a slightly more potent version of the base powerplant, and it produces 1578 horsepower. At
            our test track, the Super Sport got to 60 mph in just 2.2 seconds and, amazingly, hit 200 mph in under 15
            seconds.

        <h3>Lamborgini</h3>
        <p>
            In India, there are 5 Lamborghini cars that are featured on HT Auto, with the top picks being the
            Lamborghini Urus S, Lamborghini Huracan Evo, Lamborghini Urus Performante, Lamborghini Huracan STO,
            Lamborghini Huracan Evo Spyder. These models have an ex-showroom price starting at Rs. 3.22 Cr.
            Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A. is the world renowned ultra luxury sports car manufacturer that hails from
            Italy. It is completely owned by the famous Volkswagen Group indirectly through its subsidiary brand segment
            Audi. Lamborghini's headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in a place called Sant'Agata
            Bolognese in Italy.

            The company was initially founded by Italy's legendary manufacturer, Ferruccio Lamborghini, as an ultra
            luxury sports car company and was named as Automobile Ferruccio Lamborghini S.P.A in 1963. The basic idea
            behind it was create a brand that could take other established marques such as Ferrari hands on. In year
            1966, the firm was highly praised for its Miura Sports Coupe that carried rear mid-engine along with rear
            wheel drive which was a standard high performance feature in that era. Due to global financial meltdown and
            the historic oil crisis, in year 1973, the sales of Lamborghini sports car dropped by a huge difference. The
            firm was overtaken by three different brands after that. The first one was American Chrysler which acquired
            the Italian brand in year 1987.
